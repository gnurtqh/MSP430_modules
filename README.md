# MSP430 MICROPROCESSOR PERIPHERAL MODULE SIMULATOR
## Description

This project is a web application developed using ReactJS that aims to provide functionality for displaying the status of various external modules. It allows users to configure and control the operational modes of these modules, as well as simulate their interactions with external devices. 

## Features

1. **Status Display:** The application provides a user-friendly interface to view the status of different external modules. Users can easily monitor the current state of each module, such as whether it is active, inactive, or experiencing any issues.

2. **Module Configuration:** Users can customize the operational modes of the external modules through the application. They can easily configure settings such as activation/deactivation, scheduling, or specific behaviors for each module according to their requirements.

3. **Modeling Module Operations:** The project enables users to visualize and model the operations of the modules based on the configured settings. This feature allows users to simulate how the modules would behave in different operational modes, helping them understand the expected outcomes.

4. **Simulating Module Interactions:** The application provides the ability to mimic the interactions between the external modules and external devices. Users can simulate data exchanges, message handling, or any other communication between the modules and external devices to test their functionality.

## Installation

To run the web application locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

```
